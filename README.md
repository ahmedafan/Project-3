# Movie Correlation Analysis Project

Overview
In this project, I conducted a detailed correlation analysis of movie datasets using Python. The goal was to identify and understand the relationships between various factors such as box office revenue, budget, ratings, and genres.

Data Collection and Preparation
Data Cleaning: Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency.
Data Integration: Merged multiple datasets to create a comprehensive dataset containing movie attributes like budget, revenue, ratings, release year, country and genre.
Tools and Libraries
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations and calculations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Employed for data visualization.
SciPy: Used for statistical analysis.
Analysis
Correlation Matrix: Created a correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables such as budget, revenue, and ratings.
Heatmaps: Visualized the correlation matrix using Seaborn heatmaps to easily identify strong correlations.
Scatter Plots: Generated scatter plots to explore relationships between specific pairs of variables, such as budget vs. gross .
Key Findings
Budget vs. gross: Found a moderate positive correlation between budget and gross, indicating higher correlation.
Ratings vs. Revenue: Discovered that higher-rated movies generally tend to have better box office performance.
Visualization and Presentation
Interactive Dashboards: Created interactive visualizations using Jupyter Notebook and Plotly to allow for dynamic exploration of the data.
Reports: Compiled a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis, key findings, and visualizations.
Conclusion
This project demonstrated the ability to handle large datasets, perform thorough statistical analysis, and create insightful visualizations. The correlation analysis provided valuable insights into the factors influencing movie success, which can inform decision-making in the film industry.

This detailed description highlights your skills in data analysis, statistical methods, and visualization using Python, while showcasing your ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
